To use the Kuralynx API, you'll need to copy your agent ID from the dashboard. Follow these steps to find and copy your agent ID:

## Step 1: Locate Your Agent

Navigate to your Kuralynx dashboard and find the agent you want to use for making calls. Each agent has a unique ID that you'll need for API requests.

## Step 2: Copy Agent ID

Click on the copy icon next to your agent's ID to copy it to your clipboard. This ID will be used in the `agent_id` parameter when making API calls.

## Using Your Agent ID

Once you have copied your agent ID, you can use it in your API requests:

```bash
curl 'https://api.kuralynx.com/v1/send-call' \
--header 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
--data '{
    "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID_HERE",
    "call_to": "<mobile number to call with country code>"
}'
```

<Note>
  Make sure you're using the correct agent ID for the agent you want to handle the calls. Each agent has different configurations and capabilities.
