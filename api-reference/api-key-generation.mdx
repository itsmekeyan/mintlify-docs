## Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key, include it in the `Authorization` header of your API requests:

```bash
curl 'https://api.kuralynx.com/v1/send-call' \
--header 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
--data '{
    "agent_id": "<agent_id>",
    "call_to": "<mobile number to call with country code>"
}'
```

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you can regenerate it from the dashboard.
